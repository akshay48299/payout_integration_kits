#  Cashfree Node.Js Integration 

Python bindings for interacting with the Cashfree API. This is useful for merchants who are looking to automate their bank transfers programatically. 

# Using 

As you can see there are two files. "Execute.js" is a guide to calling the API.
NOTE : Ensure that "execute.js" and "cfPayout.js" are in the same folder.

# Setting Up

You will need to authenticate client by calling the clientAuth function as follows : 

```node.js
const user = require('./cfPayout.js');

let user2 = new user;
user2.clientAuth('dummyClientId','dummyClientSecret',"TEST/PROD");

```

**Add Beneficiary**
